# ECHO
Enhanced Communication Hearing Oscillator

## Inspiration
We want to empower the community by increasing access to the experiences that life has to offer through the use of connecting technologies.

## What it does
The ECHO bracelet has three features to help those who are hard of hearing including a metronome, morse code translator, and music interpreter.

## How we built it
The ECHO bracelet was built using an Arduino Nano, transistor, and vibration motor.

## Challenges we ran into
Getting the vibration motor to be controlled by the microcontroller proved to be difficult due to power constraints until we added a transistor.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of having a working product that is inexpensive and intuitive to use.

## What we learned
The combination of software and hardware for embedded systems can prove to difficult yet rewarding to develop.

## What's next for ECHO: Enhanced Communication Hearing Oscillator
We want to apply ML models to enable the use of sound and phrase alerts to help those hard of hearing know when an important audio event has occurred such as a bus stop announcement.
